## **How to Use This Checklist**

1. **Preparation**
   - **Request Documentation:** Ensure the designer provides an architecture diagram and any relevant documentation before the review.
   - **Schedule a Brainstorming Session:** Organize a meeting with your team to discuss the design in detail.

2. **During the Review**
   - **Follow the Checklist:** Use the checklist to guide the discussion, ensuring each area is thoroughly examined.
   - **Encourage Open Dialogue:** Allow team members to ask questions and provide input to uncover potential blind spots.
   - **Take Notes:** Document key points, feedback, and action items during the session.

3. **Post-Review Actions**
   - **Consolidate Feedback:** Compile the insights and suggestions gathered during the review.
   - **Communicate with the Designer:** Share the consolidated feedback with the designer, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
   - **Plan Follow-Ups:** Schedule additional sessions if necessary to address complex issues or iterate on the design.

## **Additional Tips**

- **Be Objective:** Focus on the design's strengths and areas for improvement without personal biases.
- **Promote Collaboration:** Foster a collaborative environment where all team members feel comfortable sharing their perspectives.
- **Prioritize Issues:** Identify which feedback points are critical and which can be addressed later to ensure the most impactful improvements are made first.
- **Iterate:** Recognize that design reviews are part of an iterative process aimed at refining and optimizing the system.
